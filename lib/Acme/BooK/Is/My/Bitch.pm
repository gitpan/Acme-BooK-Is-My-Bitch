=head1 NAME

Acme-BooK-Is-My-Bitch - BooK is my Bitch

=head1 VERSION

This document describes Acme-BooK-Is-My-Bitch version 0.02.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::BooK::Is::My::Bitch;

    my $bitch = Acme::BooK::Is::My::Bitch->new();

    my $quote = $bitch->random_quote();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Acme::BooK::Is::My::Bitch has a great story behind it.

At YAPC::EU::2006, in Birmingham, England, BooK auctioned the right
for someone to pick a module from CPAN and have that module's name
(temporarily) tattoed in his arm for all the conferences BooK would go
to during 2007.

Cog asked if the module had to exist by that time, and BooK said "No."

BIG MISTAKE!

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

BooK actually wrote part of the code for this module and suggested
some of the ideas that were turned into methods.

This module is not about Cog mocking BooK; it's rather about Cog *and*
BooK making fun of themselves.

We spent a very funny afternoon in a mini-hackathon in Birmingham
starting up this module. We finished its first version while at the
Old Joint pub with some more YAPC attendees.
