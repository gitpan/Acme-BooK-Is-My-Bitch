Acme::BooK::Is::My::Bitch
=========================

Acme::BooK::Is::My::Bitch has a great story behind it.

At YAPC::EU::2006, in Birmingham, England, BooK auctioned the right
for someone to pick a module from CPAN and have that module's name
(temporarily) tattoed in his arm for all the conferences BooK would go
to during 2007.

Cog asked if the module had to exist by that time, and BooK said "No."

BIG MISTAKE!
